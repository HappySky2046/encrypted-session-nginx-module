Name
    encrypted-session-nginx-module - encrypt and decrypt nginx variable values

    *This module is not distributed with the Nginx source.* See the
    installation instructions.

Status
    This module is production ready.

Synopsis

    # key must be of 32 bytes long
    encrypted_session_key "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456";

    # iv must not be longer than 16 bytes
    #   default: "deadbeefdeadbeef" (w/o quotes)
    encrypted_session_iv "1234567812345678";

    # default: 1d (1 day)
    encrypted_session_expires 2; # in sec

    location /encrypt {
        set $raw 'text to encrypted'; # from the ngx_rewrite module
        set_encrypt_session $session $raw;
        set_encode_base32 $session; # from the ngx_set_misc module

        add_header 'Set-Cookie: my-login=$session';  # from the ngx_headers module

        # your content handler goes here...
    }

    location /decrypt {
        set_decode_base32 $session $cookie_lz_login; # from the ngx_set_misc module
        set_decrypt_session $raw $session;

        if ($raw = '') {
            # bad session
        }

        # your content handler goes here...
    }

Description
    This module provides encryption and decryption support for
    nginx variables based on AES-256 with Mac.

    This module is usually used with the ngx_set_misc module
    ( http://github.com/agentzh/set-misc-nginx-module )
    and the standard rewrite module's directives.

    This module can be used to implement simple user login and ACL.

Directives
    encrypted_session_key
        set the key for the cipher (must be 32 bytes long)

    encrypted_session_iv
        set the init vector used for the cipher (must be no longer than 16 bytes)

    encrypted_session_expires
        set expiration time difference (in seconds)

    set_encrypt_session

    set_decrypt_session

Installation
    1. Grab the nginx source code from nginx.net (<http://nginx.net/ >), for
        example, the version 0.8.29 (see nginx compatibility),

    2. Grab the NDK module from GitHub:
        http://github.com/simpl-it/ngx_devel_kit

    3. and then build the source with this module:

        $ wget 'http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.8.29.tar.gz'
        $ tar -xzvf nginx-0.8.29.tar.gz
        $ cd nginx-0.8.29/

        # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
        $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
            --add-module=/path/to/ngx_devel_kit \
            --add-module=/path/to/encrypted-session-nginx-module

        $ make -j2
        $ make install

    Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from
    encrypted-session-nginx-module file list
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/encrypted-session-nginx-module/downloads >).

Compatibility
    The following versions of Nginx should work with this module:

    *   0.8.x (last tested version is 0.8.38)

    *   0.7.x >= 0.7.46 (last tested version is 0.7.65)

    Earlier versions of Nginx like 0.6.x and 0.5.x will *not* work.

    If you find that any particular version of Nginx above 0.7.44 does not
    work with this module, please consider reporting a bug.

Report Bugs
    Although a lot of effort has been put into testing and code tuning,
    there must be some serious bugs lurking somewhere in this module. So
    whenever you are bitten by any quirks, please don't hesitate to

    1.  send a bug report or even patches to <agentzh@gmail.com>,

    2.  or create a ticket on the issue tracking interface
        (<http://github.com/agentzh/encrypted-session-nginx-module/issues >)
        provided by GitHub.

ChangeLog

Test Suite
    This module comes with a Perl-driven test suite. The test cases
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/encrypted-session-nginx-module/tree/master/test/t/ >
    ) are declarative
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/encrypted-session-nginx-module/blob/master/test/t/sanity.t >)
    too. Thanks to the Test::Base
    (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Base >) module in the Perl world.

    To run it on your side:

        $ cd test
        $ PATH=/path/to/your/nginx-with-encrypted-session-module:$PATH prove -r t

    Test::Nginx (<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Nginx >) is used by
    the test scaffold.

    You need to terminate any Nginx processes before running the test suite
    if you have changed the Nginx server binary.

    Because a single nginx server (by default, "localhost:1984") is used
    across all the test scripts (".t" files), it's meaningless to run the
    test suite in parallel by specifying "-jN" when invoking the "prove"
    utility.

    Some parts of the test suite requires modules rewrite, and echo
    to be enabled as well when building Nginx.
